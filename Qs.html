<h2><a name="matlab_version" href="#matlab_version">What version of matlab is on the analysis environments?</a></h2>
<p>R2018a</p>

<h2><a name="matlab_licences" href="#matlab_licences">How many matlab licences are available?</a></h2>
<p>
    To check how many licences are available, run the following command in the terminal 
    on your analysis environment : 
    /mnt/cvmfs/facilities.gridpp.ac.uk/isis/matlab/R2018a/etc/glnxa64/lmutil lmstat -c 
    /var/daaas/static/license.lic -a

<h2><a name="copy_paste" href="#copy_paste">How do I copy & paste?</a></h2>
<p>
    Currently copy/paste to and from the analysis environments only works when using the browser 
    (There is work planned to implement copy/paste on RDP too).</br></br>
    You can copy and paste using the shortcuts you're used to on your computer, 
    CTRL + C, CTRL + V, CTRL + SHIFT + V, SHIFT + INS all work on Chrome and Safari.</br></br>
    Firefox doesn't allow SHIFT + INS, so if you want to paste into the terminal on your analysis environment, you will need to use the top bar.</br>
    <h3>Top Bar</h3>
    If you move your cursor towards the middle of the top of your window, a bar will drop down.</br>
    <img src="Images/topbar.png">
    </br>
    Button 1 opens the copy menu, Button 2 toggles between fullscreen and windowed, and Button 3 opens the paste menu</br>
    <img src="Images/copypastemenus.png">
    </br>
    Any text that you highlight in your analysis environment will be added to the copy bar so that you can copy it.</br>
    <img src="Images/copymenu.png">
    </br>
    To use the paste menu, click where you want the text to go in your analysis environment, then paste the your text into the paste menu, then press the paste button.</br>

<h2><a name="matlab_launch" href="#matlab_launch">Why won't matlab launch properly?</a></h2>
<p>
    There is currently an issue where matlab fails to launch and doesn't display an error. 
    This happens when there are no more matlab licences available, see 
    <a href="#matlab_licences">here</a>, to find out how to check if any licences are available. 
    If you're still having trouble please contact
